## ℹ️  INTRODUCTION

Content  :

- lovelace UI mode
- Custom light and dark themes

I'm not an expert, I'm just a hobbyist. 
The code is certainly not written in the best way, but I created this with my limited knowledge. 
I write everything myself, so please be understanding! 😊

I regularly make changes to the details or when I have new ideas.

## 🚧 INSTALLATION

It's not a one-click setup!

Some knowledge is required before diving in:

- Install a few HACS integrations necessary for proper functionality.
- Create the right sensor templates because I use them extensively and call them throughout the cards.
- Know where to copy and paste each part, whether it's the sensor templates, the contents of Lovelace, or the button card templates.
- Adjust the entities, remove the unnecessary ones, etc.

You need to adapt it to your configuration! 🙂

Dashboard created in 4 columns, thanks to the "layout card" available on HACS:
- The tab is configured with View Type: Horizontal (layout-card) / width: 350 / max_cols: 4
- A "vertical stack" column is nested within a card with "type: custom:layout-card" / "layout_type: masonry" / and has Layout options "width: 280"

I recommend installing mrs themes, then copying the button card templates, and then starting to copy pieces of Lovelace.
